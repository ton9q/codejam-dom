          <span>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion</span> (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ Kōdo
          Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurūshu), often referred to as simply Code Geass, is a Japanese anime
          series created by Sunrise, directed by Gorō Taniguchi, and written by Ichirō Ōkouchi, with
          original character designs by manga authors Clamp. Set in an alternate timeline, the
          series focuses on how the former prince Lelouch vi Britannia obtains a power known as
          Geass and decides to use it to obliterate the Holy Britannian Empire, a superpower that
          has been conquering various countries.

          Code Geass first ran in Japan on MBS from October 5, 2006, to July 28, 2007. Its sequel
          series, <span>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2</span> (コードギアス
          反逆のルルーシュR2 Kōdo Giasu Hangyaku no Rurūshu Āru Tsū), ran as a simulcast on JNN
          stations (like MBS and TBS) from April 6, 2008 to September 28, 2008. The series has also
          been adapted into various manga and light novels with the former showing various alternate
          scenarios from the TV series. Bandai Entertainment also licensed most parts from the
          franchise for English release in December 2007, airing the two TV series on Adult Swim.
          Most manga and light novels have also been published in North America by Bandai. At the
          Code Geass 10th anniversary event on November 27, 2016, it was announced that the series
          will be receiving a new anime, along with a compilation film trilogy in 2017 that recaped
          the events from both seasons of the anime series. A new film, titled
          <span>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection</span> (コードギアス 復活のルルーシュ Kōdo
          Giasu: Fukkatsu no Rurūshu), will take place in an alternate timeline told in the 3
          compilation films. It will be released in theaters on February 9, 2019.

          The anime television series has been well received in Japan, selling over a million DVD
          and Blu-ray Disc volumes. Both seasons have won several awards at the Tokyo International
          Anime Fair, Animage Anime Grand Prix, and Animation Kobe event. Critics have praised the
          series for its large audience appeal as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main
          characters and the moral questions presented.
